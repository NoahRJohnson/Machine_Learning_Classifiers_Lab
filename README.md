# Machine_Learning_Classifiers_Lab

This covers two different assignments for my Machine Learning course. Both share a lot of code, since we started working off of this [blog post](https://github.com/mGalarnyk/Python_Tutorials/blob/master/Sklearn/Logistic_Regression/LogisticRegression_MNIST_Codementor.ipynb).

One file trains a logistic regression model, while the other trains a boosted trees model using XGBoost.
